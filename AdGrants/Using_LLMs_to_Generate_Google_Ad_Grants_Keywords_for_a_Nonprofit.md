# Using LLMs to Generate Google Ad Grants Keywords for a 501(c)(3) Nonprofit

Below is a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to use Claude, ChatGPT, or similar LLMs to generate compliant keywords for your Google Ad Grants campaign while maintaining 501(c)(3) compliance requirements.

## Step 1: Understand Google Ad Grants 501(c)(3) Compliance Requirements

Before generating keywords, understand these critical compliance requirements:
- No single-word keywords (prohibited by Google Ad Grants)
- No overly generic terms (must be specific to your mission)
- Keywords must directly relate to your nonprofit mission
- Maintain minimum 5% click-through rate (CTR)
- Each ad group needs closely related keywords
- Avoid commercial intent keywords that don't support your mission

## Step 2: Prepare Your Campaign Structure

Suggested campaign name: **"Lyrical Literacy - Neural Music Development"**

Two ad groups:
1. **"Brain Exercise Songs for Children"**
2. **"Create Your Own Educational Music"**

## Step 3: Craft Effective LLM Prompts

### Initial Prompt Template

```
I need to generate keywords for my 501(c)(3) nonprofit's Google Ad Grants campaign. We focus on [brief description of Lyrical Literacy]. 

Our campaign is called "[campaign name]" with two ad groups:
1. "[Ad Group 1 Name]" - [brief description]
2. "[Ad Group 2 Name]" - [brief description]

Please generate at least 50 compliant keywords for each ad group that:
- Contain 2+ words (no single-word keywords)
- Are specific to our mission (no generic terms)
- Use a mix of match types (exact, phrase, broad)
- Are organized by search intent (awareness, consideration, conversion)
- Directly relate to our nonprofit activities

For context, here's more information about our organization: [paste 2-3 sentences from your mission/about us]
```

## Step 4: Generate Keywords for Ad Group 1

### Detailed Prompt for "Brain Exercise Songs for Children"

```
I need to generate keywords for my 501(c)(3) nonprofit's Google Ad Grants campaign. We're Humanitarians AI focusing on Lyrical Literacy - a neuroscience-based initiative that uses music to enhance cognitive and language development.

Our campaign is called "Lyrical Literacy - Neural Music Development" with an ad group named "Brain Exercise Songs for Children" that promotes educational songs designed based on neuroscience principles to enhance cognitive development and language acquisition in children.

Please generate at least 50 compliant Google Ad Grants keywords that:
- Contain 2+ words (no single-word keywords as they violate Google Ad Grants policies)
- Are specific to our mission (no generic terms)
- Use a mix of match types (exact, phrase, broad)
- Are organized by search intent (awareness, consideration, conversion)
- Directly relate to our nonprofit educational activities

For context, our mission: "Lyrical Literacy is exercise for the brain. Through tongue twisters, lullabies, and nursery rhymes, we teach language by singing basic vocabulary and survival phrases, engaging multiple brain regions simultaneously to create balanced cognitive development."
```

## Step 5: Review and Refine First Set of Keywords

When the LLM generates the first set, review them for:
- Compliance with 501(c)(3) and Google Ad Grants policies
- Relevance to your mission
- Specificity (avoid generic terms)
- Commercial intent (remove any that suggest commercial services)

Ask the LLM to refine any keywords that:
- Are too generic
- Could violate Google policies
- Don't align with your nonprofit mission

## Step 6: Generate Keywords for Ad Group 2

### Detailed Prompt for "Create Your Own Educational Music"

```
I need to generate keywords for my 501(c)(3) nonprofit's Google Ad Grants campaign. We're Humanitarians AI focusing on Lyrical Literacy - a program that leverages AI to create educational music for cognitive development.

Our campaign is called "Lyrical Literacy - Neural Music Development" with an ad group named "Create Your Own Educational Music" that promotes tools and resources for creating custom educational music using AI technologies like Suno and Udio.

Please generate at least 50 compliant Google Ad Grants keywords that:
- Contain 2+ words (no single-word keywords as they violate Google Ad Grants policies)
- Are specific to our mission (no generic terms)
- Use a mix of match types (exact, phrase, broad)
- Are organized by search intent (awareness, consideration, conversion)
- Directly relate to our nonprofit educational activities
- Focus on creating/developing educational music with AI

For context, we provide: "AI-powered tools and resources that help users create customized songs tailored to individual learning objectives, cultural contexts, and developmental needs. Our technology uses natural language processing to generate contextually appropriate lyrics and music generation algorithms that create culturally relevant and age-appropriate melodies."
```

## Step 7: Organize and Validate Keywords

Once you have both sets of keywords:

1. **Organize by match type:**
   - Exact match: [brain development songs]
   - Phrase match: "music for cognitive development"
   - Broad match: educational songs for children

2. **Group by search intent:**
   - Awareness: educational benefits of music
   - Consideration: brain exercise songs for toddlers
   - Conversion: free neuroscience-based children's songs

3. **Validate against compliance checklist:**
   - No single-word keywords ✓
   - No overly generic terms ✓
   - Mission-relevant ✓
   - Minimum 2-3 words each ✓
   - No commercial intent ✓

## Step 8: Expand Keywords Using LLM Analysis

Ask the LLM to analyze your existing keywords and suggest expansions:

```
I have these initial keywords for our "Brain Exercise Songs for Children" ad group. Please analyze them and suggest:

1. Long-tail variations (4+ words)
2. Question-based keywords (how, why, what)
3. Location-based variations
4. Age-specific variations
5. Problem/solution variations

Please ensure all suggestions maintain 501(c)(3) compliance and Google Ad Grants requirements (no single-word terms, no overly generic terms, must be mission-relevant).
```

## Step 9: Use LLM to Check for Missing Keyword Opportunities

```
Based on our mission of using neuroscience-based music for cognitive development in children, what keyword themes or categories might I be missing? Please suggest 5 additional keyword categories with 10 example keywords each that would be compliant with Google Ad Grants policies and relevant to our 501(c)(3) mission.
```

## Step 10: Final Compliance Check and Implementation

Have the LLM perform a final compliance check:

```
Please review these 100+ keywords for our Google Ad Grants campaign and flag any that might:
1. Violate Google Ad Grants policies
2. Be too generic
3. Not align with our 501(c)(3) mission
4. Have commercial intent
5. Be single-word terms

For any flagged keywords, please suggest compliant alternatives.
```

## Important Tips for Success:

1. **Be specific about your mission** - The more details you provide about your nonprofit's activities, the more relevant the keywords will be

2. **Clearly explain compliance requirements** - Explicitly mention Google Ad Grants policies in your prompts

3. **Iterate and refine** - Ask the LLM to expand on promising keyword categories

4. **Include negative keywords** - Ask the LLM to suggest negative keywords to prevent irrelevant clicks:
   ```
   Please suggest 20 negative keywords we should add to our Google Ad Grants campaign to prevent irrelevant clicks and maintain our CTR above 5%.
   ```

5. **Request keyword organization** - Ask the LLM to structure keywords by:
   - Search intent
   - Match type
   - User journey stage
   - Specific program areas

By following this process, you can generate well over 100 compliant, relevant keywords for each ad group while maintaining Google Ad Grants 501(c)(3) compliance requirements. This structured approach ensures your keywords directly support your nonprofit mission of using music for cognitive development while maximizing your Google Ad Grants effectiveness.
