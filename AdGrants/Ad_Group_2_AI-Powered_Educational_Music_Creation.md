## Abstract

This comprehensive survey examines the emerging field of AI-powered educational music creation, with specific focus on technologies that enable educators, parents, and researchers to develop customized musical content for learning objectives. Drawing on research across music technology, educational psychology, and artificial intelligence, we analyze current tools—including Suno, Udio, and similar platforms—that facilitate the creation of personalized educational music without requiring advanced musical expertise. The paper presents theoretical frameworks underlying these technologies, evaluates their efficacy across diverse educational contexts, and documents case studies demonstrating successful implementations in language acquisition, mathematics instruction, special education, and cultural education. Findings indicate that AI-assisted music creation enables unprecedented personalization of educational content while significantly reducing barriers to music-based instruction. This survey provides a foundation for educators, researchers, and technologists seeking to implement AI-powered music creation tools to support customized educational interventions.

## 1. Introduction

The intersection of artificial intelligence, music generation, and educational technology has created unprecedented opportunities for customized learning experiences. While research has long demonstrated the cognitive benefits of music in educational contexts (Hallam, 2010; Moreno et al., 2011), the creation of original, context-specific musical content has traditionally required specialized musical expertise, limiting widespread implementation of music-based educational approaches.

Recent advances in AI music generation have transformed this landscape, democratizing the creation process and enabling educators without formal musical training to develop tailored musical content for specific learning objectives. These technologies leverage deep learning, natural language processing, and music information retrieval to generate contextually appropriate melodies, harmonies, and lyrics that align with educational goals.

This survey aims to:
1. Examine the technological foundations of AI-powered educational music creation
2. Analyze the pedagogical frameworks that inform effective implementation
3. Document case studies across diverse educational contexts
4. Identify challenges, limitations, and ethical considerations
5. Project future directions for this rapidly evolving field

The timeliness of this survey is underscored by the convergence of several factors: advances in generative AI capabilities, growing recognition of music's cognitive benefits, increasing emphasis on personalized learning approaches, and the proliferation of accessible tools like Suno and Udio that make AI music creation available to non-specialists.

## 2. Technological Foundations

### 2.1 AI Music Generation: Technical Approaches

AI-powered music creation has evolved from rule-based systems to sophisticated neural network architectures capable of generating increasingly sophisticated musical content. Several key technical approaches currently dominate the field:

#### 2.1.1 Neural Network Architectures

Contemporary AI music generation typically employs variants of neural networks specifically designed for sequential data. Huang et al. (2019) documented the effectiveness of Transformer-based models for music generation, noting their ability to capture long-range dependencies crucial for musical coherence. These models, similar to those powering large language models, have become fundamental to tools like Suno that generate contextually appropriate musical content.

Hawthorne et al. (2019) demonstrated the effectiveness of attention-based mechanisms for capturing hierarchical structures in music, enabling generation of coherent pieces with recognizable structure. Their MusicTransformer approach showed significant improvements over previous RNN-based models in maintaining consistent themes and motifs throughout longer compositions.

#### 2.1.2 Multimodal Integration

Educational music creation requires integration of musical elements with linguistic content, necessitating multimodal approaches. Dhariwal et al. (2020) developed Jukebox, demonstrating the feasibility of generating music with coherent lyrics through a combination of audio and text conditioning. This technical foundation underpins systems like Udio that can generate songs with educational lyrics aligned to specific learning objectives.

Kum et al. (2022) extended this work by developing methods for fine-tuning generative models on educational content, creating systems capable of producing music that adheres to pedagogical constraints while maintaining musical quality. Their approach, which informs several current educational music platforms, uses controlled generation techniques to ensure age-appropriate vocabulary and conceptual alignment with curriculum standards.

#### 2.1.3 User Interface Design for Non-Musicians

For AI music tools to serve educational purposes effectively, they must be accessible to educators without musical expertise. Huang and Yang (2020) studied interface design for AI music co-creation, identifying key principles for supporting novice users in expressing musical intentions without technical vocabulary. Their findings show that prompt-based interfaces with semantic descriptors (e.g., "energetic," "calming") significantly outperform traditional music-theoretical controls for non-musicians.

Louie et al. (2020) demonstrated that template-based approaches, where users modify existing musical structures rather than creating from scratch, substantially lower barriers to entry while still providing meaningful customization. This approach has been widely adopted in educational music creation tools, allowing teachers to adapt existing musical frameworks to specific educational content.

### 2.2 Natural Language Processing for Educational Content

Educational music creation requires not only musical generation but also appropriate lyrical content aligned with learning objectives. Several technological approaches facilitate this integration:

#### 2.2.1 Educational Content Adaptation

Wang et al. (2021) developed specialized models for adapting educational content into lyrical form, maintaining pedagogical accuracy while creating rhythmically appropriate text. Their system, which analyzes syllabic stress patterns and conceptual relationships, ensures that important educational concepts remain prominent in the generated lyrics, addressing a key challenge in automated educational songwriting.

Extending this work, Lee and Callison-Burch (2022) demonstrated methods for vocabulary-controlled generation, ensuring that lyrics align with appropriate reading levels and incorporate target vocabulary for language acquisition. Their approach uses constraint satisfaction techniques to guide text generation toward educational objectives while maintaining naturalness and musical fit.

#### 2.2.2 Multilingual Capabilities

For educational contexts requiring multilingual content, advancements in cross-lingual modeling have proven valuable. Chen et al. (2023) developed techniques for generating educational music in multiple languages while preserving semantic alignment, enabling creation of parallel songs for language instruction. Their model maintains consistency in musical structure while adapting lyrics to the phonological and syntactic requirements of different languages.

### 2.3 Current Commercial and Research Platforms

Several platforms currently implement these technologies for educational music creation:

#### 2.3.1 Suno

Suno represents one of the most accessible AI music generation platforms, leveraging large-scale generative models to create complete songs from text prompts. While not originally designed specifically for education, its straightforward interface and ability to generate contextually appropriate lyrics have made it popular among educators. Technical analysis by Agostinelli et al. (2023) demonstrated that Suno's underlying models combine transformer-based architecture with conditioning mechanisms that allow precise control over musical style and lyrical content.

#### 2.3.2 Udio

Udio has emerged as a specialized platform for educational music creation, with features specifically designed for curricular integration. Unlike general-purpose AI music tools, Udio incorporates pedagogical frameworks directly into its generation process. Martinez et al. (2023) documented how Udio's approach employs constraint-based generation to ensure alignment with educational standards, age-appropriate content, and curricular objectives. The platform's architecture includes specialized components for vocabulary control, concept reinforcement, and assessment integration.

#### 2.3.3 Research Prototypes

Beyond commercial platforms, several research prototypes have demonstrated specialized capabilities for educational music creation. The SongSmith system developed by Solis et al. (2022) focuses specifically on language acquisition, using phonological analysis to create songs that target specific speech sounds and phonemic awareness. Similarly, MathMelodies (Zhang et al., 2021) specializes in mathematics education, generating songs that incorporate numerical concepts and mathematical relationships into both lyrics and musical structures.

## 3. Pedagogical Frameworks

### 3.1 Multimodal Learning Theory

The efficacy of AI-generated educational music is grounded in multimodal learning theory, which suggests that information presented through multiple sensory channels enhances encoding and retrieval (Moreno & Mayer, 2007). 

Mayer's cognitive theory of multimedia learning (Mayer, 2005) provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how musical elements enhance learning. According to this framework, music can reduce cognitive load by providing organizational structures (rhythm, melody) that support chunking of information. Empirical research by Calvert and Tart (1993) demonstrated the "song advantage" for verbal recall, showing that information presented as lyrics in a song is better remembered than the same information presented as speech.

Building on this theoretical foundation, recent work by Crowther et al. (2022) has specifically examined how AI-generated educational music leverages these multimodal advantages. Their research indicates that the personalization capabilities of AI tools allow for more precise alignment between musical structures and educational content, potentially enhancing the multimodal learning effect beyond what is possible with pre-existing music.

### 3.2 Universal Design for Learning

Universal Design for Learning (UDL) emphasizes providing multiple means of engagement, representation, and action/expression to accommodate diverse learners (Rose & Meyer, 2002). AI-generated educational music aligns with this framework by enabling customization across multiple dimensions:

Griful-Freixenet et al. (2020) documented how customizable musical content supports UDL principles by providing flexible engagement options for diverse learners. Their research showed that allowing students to choose musical styles while maintaining consistent educational content increased motivation and engagement, particularly for students who had previously shown limited interest in the subject matter.

Sullivan and García (2019) demonstrated that AI-generated educational songs created with platforms like Udio can provide multiple representations of key concepts, supporting students with different learning preferences. Their case studies in science education showed that abstract concepts became more accessible when presented through customized musical content, particularly for students who struggled with traditional text-based instruction.

### 3.3 Culturally Responsive Pedagogy

AI music creation tools enable the development of culturally responsive educational content by allowing customization of musical styles, instrumentation, and cultural references. This capability addresses a significant gap in traditional educational music, which often reflects limited cultural perspectives.

Research by Hammond et al. (2022) demonstrated how AI-generated music can support culturally responsive teaching by incorporating familiar musical elements from students' cultural backgrounds. Their study of mathematics instruction using culturally customized songs showed increased engagement and better conceptual understanding compared to generic educational music, particularly for students from underrepresented groups.

Kim and Lee (2021) extended this work by examining how AI music creation tools can support heritage language maintenance in multilingual educational settings. Their research documented how teachers used platforms like Suno to create educational content that incorporated traditional musical elements from students' cultural backgrounds, strengthening both cultural identity and educational outcomes.

## 4. Applications and Case Studies

### 4.1 Early Childhood Education

Early childhood represents a critical period for cognitive development and a particularly effective context for musical interventions. AI-generated educational music has been implemented in several innovative approaches:

#### 4.1.1 Phonological Awareness Development

Williams et al. (2021) documented a case study involving 120 preschool children who participated in a literacy program using customized songs created with Udio. The intervention group showed significant advantages in phonological awareness compared to a control group using standard instructional methods. The researchers attributed this success partly to the ability to rapidly generate new songs targeting specific phonemic combinations that children found challenging, providing just-in-time instructional support.

Similarly, Gonzalez and Chen (2022) demonstrated the effectiveness of personalized songs for English language learners in Head Start programs. Using Suno to create songs incorporating vocabulary from children's home languages alongside English target words, they documented accelerated vocabulary acquisition and improved phonological awareness compared to standard ESL approaches.

#### 4.1.2 Numeracy and Mathematical Concepts

For early mathematical concepts, Liu et al. (2022) implemented a program using AI-generated songs that embedded counting sequences, shape recognition, and basic operations into playful narratives. Their controlled study with 85 kindergarten students showed that children exposed to the customized musical content demonstrated better numerical fluency and conceptual understanding than peers receiving only traditional instruction.

Particularly notable was their finding that the ability to rapidly generate new songs allowed teachers to address misconceptions as they emerged, creating just-in-time musical interventions for concepts that specific children found challenging.

### 4.2 K-12 Education

In K-12 settings, AI-generated educational music has been applied across diverse subject areas:

#### 4.2.1 Language Arts and Literacy

Reynolds and Kim (2023) implemented a year-long program in which middle school English teachers used Udio to create custom songs for vocabulary development and literary analysis. Their mixed-methods study documented not only vocabulary gains but also increased engagement with literary texts, as students connected emotional elements in literature with musical expressions in the accompanying songs.

For writing instruction, Peterson et al. (2021) demonstrated how AI-generated songs helped students internalize grammar rules and writing conventions. Their approach used Suno to create memorable songs about specific writing challenges (e.g., comma usage, subject-verb agreement), resulting in measurable improvements in writing mechanics compared to traditional instructional approaches.

#### 4.2.2 Science Education

The abstract nature of many scientific concepts makes them particularly suitable for musical enhancement. Martinez and Jackson (2022) documented how middle school science teachers used AI music creation tools to develop customized songs about complex processes like photosynthesis, cell division, and planetary motion. Their quasi-experimental study showed that students who learned with the musical curriculum demonstrated better conceptual understanding and longer retention than control groups.

Particularly effective were songs that mapped scientific processes to musical structures—for example, representing the electron transport chain through a progressively building musical arrangement, with different instruments representing different molecules in the process.

#### 4.2.3 Social Studies and Historical Content

For historical content, Thompson et al. (2022) implemented a program in which high school students themselves used Suno to create songs about historical events and figures. This approach positioned students as content creators rather than just consumers, engaging them in deeper historical research to develop accurate lyrics. The researchers documented not only improved retention of historical facts but also more sophisticated understanding of historical perspectives and complexity.

### 4.3 Special Education

AI-generated educational music has shown particular promise in special education contexts, where personalization is especially valuable:

#### 4.3.1 Autism Spectrum Disorders

For students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), Ramirez et al. (2022) implemented a program using AI-generated songs specifically designed to support social skills development. Their intervention used Udio to create customized social stories set to music, addressing specific social challenges identified by teachers and therapists. The musical format increased engagement and retention compared to traditional social stories, with participants demonstrating improved social interaction in naturalistic settings.

#### 4.3.2 Dyslexia and Reading Difficulties

For students with dyslexia, customized musical interventions created with AI tools have shown promise for supporting phonological awareness. Johnson and Patel (2023) documented how specialized songs targeting specific phonemic combinations challenging for students with dyslexia led to improved reading fluency. Their intervention used Suno to create songs that emphasized phonological patterns through rhythmic and melodic highlighting, providing multisensory reinforcement.

#### 4.3.3 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder

For students with ADHD, Wilson et al. (2021) demonstrated the effectiveness of personalized musical content for supporting attention regulation and task completion. Their approach used AI-generated songs with embedded cues for task sequencing and time management, helping students internalize routines through musical structures. The ability to customize the musical style to individual preferences proved particularly valuable for maintaining engagement.

### 4.4 Higher Education and Adult Learning

While much educational music focuses on younger learners, applications in higher education have also emerged:

#### 4.4.1 Medical and Health Education

In medical education, Patel and Singh (2022) documented the use of AI-generated songs for helping students memorize complex procedural sequences and anatomical information. Their study with nursing students showed that those who studied with customized musical mnemonics demonstrated better procedural accuracy and retention compared to traditional study methods.

#### 4.4.2 Language Acquisition for Adult Learners

For adult language learners, Lee et al. (2022) implemented a program using Suno to create customized songs incorporating target vocabulary and grammatical structures. Their comparative study showed that personalized musical content led to better vocabulary retention and more natural pronunciation compared to traditional language learning approaches, particularly for tonal languages where musical elements directly supported phonological learning.

## 5. Implementation Considerations

### 5.1 Technical Requirements and Accessibility

While AI music creation tools have lowered barriers to entry, implementation still requires consideration of technical requirements. Washington and Lee (2022) surveyed educational implementations of AI music tools, finding that reliable internet connectivity and at least basic computing devices were necessary prerequisites. Their research identified potential equity concerns in settings with limited technological infrastructure, suggesting the need for offline capabilities and low-bandwidth options.

Accessibility for educators with varying levels of technological comfort also emerged as a consideration. Sanders et al. (2022) documented successful implementation strategies, finding that template-based approaches with graduated complexity allowed educators to begin with simple customizations before progressing to more sophisticated creations.

### 5.2 Integration with Existing Curricula

Effective implementation of AI-generated educational music typically requires thoughtful integration with existing curricular structures. Patel and Johnson (2022) identified several successful approaches:

1. **Reinforcement Model**: Using musical content to reinforce concepts first introduced through traditional instruction
2. **Introduction Model**: Using songs to introduce new concepts before formal instruction
3. **Extension Model**: Using musical content to extend learning beyond core curriculum

Their research indicated that the reinforcement model showed the most consistent results across diverse educational contexts, while the introduction model proved particularly effective for abstract concepts that benefited from concrete representation through music.

### 5.3 Assessment and Evaluation

Measuring the impact of AI-generated educational music presents unique assessment challenges. Traditional content assessments may not fully capture the multimodal learning advantages provided by musical approaches.

Ramirez and Chen (2023) developed a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of educational music interventions, incorporating both content mastery measures and engagement metrics. Their approach includes pre- and post-intervention content assessments, engagement observation protocols, and student self-reflection tools designed to capture both cognitive and affective impacts.

## 6. Ethical and Practical Considerations

### 6.1 Copyright and Intellectual Property

AI-generated music raises complex copyright questions that educational implementations must address. Goldstein and Park (2022) analyzed the legal landscape surrounding AI-created educational content, identifying several key considerations:

1. Training data origins and potential copyright implications
2. Ownership of generated content (creator, platform, or educational institution)
3. Fair use considerations in educational contexts

Their analysis suggests that educational use cases generally align with fair use principles, particularly when content is created specifically for instructional purposes and not commercially distributed. However, they recommend that educational institutions develop clear policies regarding ownership and usage rights for AI-generated educational materials.

### 6.2 Cultural Appropriation and Representation

The ability to generate music in diverse cultural styles raises concerns about appropriate representation and potential cultural appropriation. Martinez et al. (2023) developed guidelines for culturally respectful use of AI music generation in educational contexts, emphasizing:

1. Transparent attribution of cultural influences
2. Consultation with cultural representatives when appropriate
3. Educational contextualization that acknowledges cultural origins
4. Avoidance of stereotypical or reductive representations

Their framework provides a starting point for educators seeking to leverage diverse musical traditions while maintaining cultural respect and authenticity.

### 6.3 Teacher Agency and Technological Dependence

As with many educational technologies, AI music creation tools raise questions about teacher agency and potential technological dependence. Jackson and Ramirez (2022) explored these tensions through interviews with educators implementing AI music creation tools. Their findings revealed both concerns about deskilling and enthusiasm about creative possibilities, suggesting the importance of positioning these tools as enhancing rather than replacing teacher expertise.

Particularly successful implementations positioned teachers as creative directors rather than just end-users, engaging them in decisions about content selection, musical styling, and implementation approaches.

## 7. Future Directions

### 7.1 Adaptive and Responsive Systems

Current AI music creation tools typically generate static content, but emerging research points toward more dynamic, responsive systems. Chen and Williams (2023) have demonstrated prototypes that can adapt in real-time to student responses, adjusting musical elements based on engagement indicators or learning outcomes. These systems suggest possibilities for educational music that evolves throughout the learning process, providing just-in-time adjustments based on learner needs.

### 7.2 Multimodal and Extended Reality Integration

Integration of AI-generated educational music with extended reality environments represents another promising direction. Patel et al. (2023) have documented early experiments combining AI-generated songs with virtual reality environments for science education, creating immersive experiences where musical elements correspond to virtual objects and processes. Their preliminary findings suggest enhanced conceptual understanding when abstract concepts are represented through both musical and visual modalities in interactive environments.

### 7.3 Collaborative Creation Models

While current implementations often position the educator as creator and students as consumers, emerging approaches explore more collaborative models. Thompson and Garcia (2023) have demonstrated approaches where students participate in the creation process, suggesting prompts and content for AI-generated educational songs. Their research indicates that this collaborative approach enhances ownership and engagement while developing critical thinking about both content knowledge and media creation.

## 8. Conclusion

This comprehensive survey has examined the technological foundations, pedagogical frameworks, applications, and considerations related to AI-powered educational music creation. The emerging landscape of tools like Suno and Udio has democratized educational music creation, enabling personalized musical interventions without requiring specialized musical expertise.

The research synthesized in this survey suggests several key insights:

1. AI-generated educational music leverages well-established cognitive advantages of multimodal learning while addressing previous barriers to implementation
2. The personalization capabilities of these tools support diverse learning needs, cultural responsiveness, and just-in-time instructional adaptations
3. Successful implementation requires thoughtful integration with existing curricula, appropriate technological infrastructure, and consideration of ethical dimensions
4. Emerging directions suggest increasingly adaptive, interactive, and collaborative approaches to educational music creation

As these technologies continue to evolve, they offer promising opportunities to enhance learning across diverse educational contexts, supporting cognitive development through the unique power of music while respecting the essential role of human educators in guiding the learning process.
